                <h3>Monster</h3>
                <p>We had a project to make from the Visual Effects course
                    video in After Effects.
                    <br>
                    I called him Monster, and it's about a little boy who dreams of monsters. I was drawing
                    worked on illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and then in After Effects
                    the animation itself.
                     <br>
                    In Premiere, I inserted the sound that I am
                    further refined to fit the events of the film.

                <h3>Clown</h3>
                <p>From the subject Praktikum 3D modeling and animation had
                    we are tasked to create a 20 second animation with the given
                    clown model. 
                    <br>
                     We had to come up with a scenography and yes in the first two seconds the clown jumped out of the box and was obliged
                    a close-up shot where we had to do some vocalization
                    the sentences we come up with.
                    <br>
                     My idea was that the ball breaks the window
                    and wake up the clown. He got angry and said, "Who is bothering me?
                    rest" and clicks the secret self-destruct button behind the shelf,
                    which awakens another devilish clown. The first clown actually was
                    devil box cover.
