                <h3>Monster</h3>
                <p>The project from the Visual Effects course was to create a video in After Effects.
                    <br>
                    I called him Monster, and it's about a little boy who dreams of monsters. I called it "Monster" and it's about a little boy who dreams of monsters. I drew the illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and then in After Effects I created the animation.
                     <br>
                     In Premiere, I added sound that I further edited to fit the events in the film.

                <h3>Clown</h3>
                <p>For the Practicum 3D Modeling and Animation course, we had the task of creating a 20-second animation with the given model of a clown.
                    <br>
                    We had to create a scenography and in the first two seconds the clown had to jump out of the box. Also, we had to have one close-up shot where we had to do the vocalization of a sentence that we came up with.
                    <br>
                    My idea was that a ball breaks the window and wakes up the clown. He gets angry, says "Who is disturbing my peace," and clicks the secret self-destruct button behind the shelf, which wakes up another devilish clown. The first clown was actually the lid of the devil's box
