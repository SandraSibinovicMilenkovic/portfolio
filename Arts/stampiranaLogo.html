     <h3>Štampirana</h3>  
       <p> We had to use our knowledge for a project at the university
        which we acquired in the course Application of vector graphics in design.
        We didn't have a special task, just to do something
        that we would like to go through all the stages of the creative process
        until we make a final solution.
        <br>
        We wanted to open 3D with my boyfriend and his brothers
        to the printing house to print for students from Architecture
        model faculty.
        <br>
        We came up with the idea to call the company Stampirana kao pressta i
        piranha. My task was to create a logo so that the students
        heard about us.

       <p> 
        I made a piranha that keeps its round parts like that
        would resemble a fish, and the interior is done in a poly design
        because the basics of 3D modeling are polygons. We also made
        site but it is not yet operational.
