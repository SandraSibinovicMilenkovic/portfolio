                    <h3>Groom to bloom</h3>
                    <p>
                       I had a project from the Design of Publications course
                        I make a three-panel brochure. I chose a hair salon
                        and dog grooming - Groom to Bloom.
                        <br>
                        <br>
    
                        The brochure provides the services that Groom to bloom provides, a map
                        where it is, as well as the most basic things that every owner needs
                        to know when it comes to their houses.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         The brochure is humorous and
                        cheerful design to bring smiles to animal lovers and yes
                        they choose Groom to Bloom for their homes.
